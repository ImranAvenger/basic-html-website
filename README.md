# Basic HTML Website

Build a simple, well-structured multi-section website using only HTML. Focus on semantics and layout structure; do not add any CSS or JavaScript. Styling will be handled in a separate project.

Challenge: https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website

## Objectives
- Use semantic HTML5 elements to organize content.
- Separate global sections: header, nav, main, aside, footer.
- Keep content accessible and logically grouped across pages.

## Requirements
- Semantic elements: header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer.
- A navigation menu linking between pages.
- Meaningful headings and document outline (h1â€“h6).
- No CSS and no JavaScript.
- Valid, accessible HTML (use alt text, labels where applicable).

## Getting Started
1. Create an index.html with a proper HTML5 boilerplate.
2. Add the site header, navigation, main content sections, optional sidebar (aside), and a footer.
3. Optionally add additional pages (e.g., about.html, contact.html) and link them from the nav.
4. Open the HTML files in a browser to review structure.

## Suggested Structure
- index.html (homepage with site overview)
- about.html (optional)
- contact.html (optional)

Core sections to include on each page:
- Header: site title/logo
- Nav: links to all pages
- Main: page-specific content organized with section/article
- Aside: optional supporting info
- Footer: copyright and contact info

## Tips
- Reuse the same header/nav/footer across pages for consistency.
- Write clear, descriptive link text and headings.
- Validate your HTML: https://validator.w3.org/
